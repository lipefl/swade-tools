## About the Module
A series of automations and quality of life improvements to use with SWADE system.

### Automation on Combat
- Detect targets in combat, **show hit/raise, damage and soak rolls**. All calculations automatically, just click to apply/roll.
- Automatic Situational modifiers for targets: **Distance, Gang Up, Ranged in Melee, Scale** etc. It's shown hidden by default, always if you want.
- Auto **Remove/Roll Status during combat**, no need to check or confirm
- **Min Str** affects damage dice (for Strength) and also trait rolls based on armor equipped or ranged weapon. Edges like Soldier are detected automatically.
- **Conviction support**: At the end of conviction, you are asked if you want to spend a benny to keep it active for another round.
- **Auto detect egdes/abilities** for bonus on rolls based on their names (support to some settings, allow to change names).
- Suport for **Cover** through items.
- **Out of control** will roll the table automatically for vehicle combat
- Suport for **setting rules** based on the swade system config
- **GM benny** will be used from directly from NPC if they have it, or from GM pool. Automatically!

### Automations to spare the GM
- **Auto Update Max Wounds** based on Wildcard/Extra and Size
- **Automatically link (and unlink) tokens** if the actor is wildcard (or not)
- **Auto Update Token** width/height based on Size.
- PCs are **friendly**, NPCs are **hostile** by default

### User Friendly for beginners
- **Simpler rolls**: by default, a simple dialog box with modifier when rolling Attributes and Skills. Same principle is applied to weapons and powers: a dialog box instead of sending to chat. The only player seeing it is the player using it.
- **More visible icons** for status, wound and fatigue
- **Clean and simple roll in the chat**. With tiny button to rerrol with benny or free reroll. For the GM, extra buttons to add modifier (after roll), re-targeting or calculate raises.
- **Template buttons for powers** directly, with just one click
- Asks when a weapon/power don't have a **defined trait** and redefine it for the roll
- Visible **Critical Failure** in the chat 

### Macros
- Easier **Boost/Lower Trait**
- Mark all PCs as **Friendly** and NPCs as **Hostile**. For those who haven't been using SWADE Tools.
- **Attack macro** to simplify for the GM
- **Roll once for all selected**, using the same trait

### Add More Things (if you want)
- Suport for **Called Shots**
- Quick select Aditional Modifiers: **Multi-Actions, Cover, Illumination**
